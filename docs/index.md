# Who I am

I am Kleber Yokota, passionate about data. I worked as a Data Scientist and now as a Data Engineer. The purpose of this text is to document the studies and discoveries

I make during my free time. Since technology evolves and changes so rapidly, it’s important to have a place to take notes and share them with others who have similar interests in tech.

As a Data Engineer, I need to use many technologies these days, and having a dedicated space is crucial. My home lab serves as my playground, where I can experiment, test, and learn about different technologies. This space is not just for Data Engineering or technologies related to data infrastructure. It’s a place to explore the full spectrum of tools and frameworks that deal with data, from Machine Learning Engineering to LLMs (Large Language Models) and beyond. I see the increasing need to understand the full ecosystem of data-related technologies, as they all play a role in how we process, analyze, and utilize data.

## Home Lab

Why did I decide to use a PC as a home lab? Well, since I decided to become a Data Scientist, I followed many online tutorials to run my first model or study Python. There was a lot of copying and pasting on my laptop, but I had no idea what I was doing, which caused many things to break. I installed software I didn't fully understand, and I had to format my PC multiple times. In some cases, I even overheated and overloaded my laptop. From all of that, I learned that I needed a space where I could make mistakes without impacting my daily work.

This led me to learn tools like pyenv, Docker, VMs, and more. Eventually, I needed something more robust—something used in production environments. That’s when I began using Kubernetes (K8s).

Now, my home lab runs on Talos, a lightweight distribution that uses K8s and provides security by default. This setup is incredibly helpful because my goal is to create an environment that mirrors production systems. I don’t need to be an expert in K8s to manage security features. Honestly, if I had a place where I could run as root without worrying too much about security, I’d probably encounter fewer problems but also wouldn’t learn as much. When you’re forced to solve problems, you begin to understand the inner workings of the tools you're using and the systems you’re building.
